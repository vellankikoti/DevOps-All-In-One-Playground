# Terraform - DevOps All-In-One Playground

This folder contains Terraform configurations for provisioning infrastructure on AWS. It includes exercises to help DevOps engineers practice commonly used Terraform setups and scenarios.

## Overview

The `main.tf` file provisions an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS, enabling deployment of the DevOps All-In-One Playground application in a managed Kubernetes environment. Additionally, the `terraform/exercises/` folder contains independent Terraform files that allow you to explore common infrastructure scenarios.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
2. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with credentials that have sufficient permissions for managing AWS resources.
3. **IAM Roles**: Make sure you have necessary IAM roles for provisioning EKS clusters, VPCs, EC2 instances, and other resources.

## Main EKS Configuration

The main Terraform file `main.tf` includes a backend configuration for remote state storage. This EKS configuration uses an S3 bucket for state management, which is essential for collaborative or long-term infrastructure projects.

### Setup Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Terraform

1. Navigate to the `terraform/` folder.
2. Run the following command to initialize Terraform and install necessary plugins:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

### Step 2: Define Variables

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `terraform/` folder to define variable values (replace with your actual values):
   ```hcl
   eks_role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eks-cluster-role"
   eks_node_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eks-node-role"
   subnet_ids       = ["subnet-0bb1c79de3EXAMPLE", "subnet-0bb1c79de4EXAMPLE"]
   ```

### Step 3: Apply Terraform

1. Run the following command to review the changes Terraform will apply:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. To create the infrastructure, execute:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

3. Once applied, Terraform will output the cluster name and `kubeconfig` details.

### Step 4: Configure kubectl

1. Use the generated `kubeconfig` to configure access to the EKS cluster:
   ```bash
   aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name devops-cluster
   ```

2. Verify the connection to the cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

### Cleaning Up

To delete the EKS cluster and all associated resources, use:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Terraform Exercises

The `terraform/exercises/` folder includes Terraform configurations for the following scenarios:

1. **List EC2 Instances**: Lists all EC2 instances in the specified region.
   - **Filename**: `list_ec2_instances.tf`
2. **Create Single EC2 Instance**: Provisions a single EC2 instance.
   - **Filename**: `create_single_ec2.tf`
3. **Create 3 EC2 Instances**: Provisions three EC2 instances.
   - **Filename**: `create_three_ec2_instances.tf`
4. **Create 100 EC2 Instances**: Provisions a batch of 100 EC2 instances.
   - **Filename**: `create_hundred_ec2_instances.tf`
5. **Create VPC and Subnets**: Provisions a VPC with associated subnets.
   - **Filename**: `create_vpc.tf`
6. **Create S3 Bucket with Versioning**: Sets up an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled.
   - **Filename**: `create_s3_bucket.tf`
7. **Motivational Greeting EC2 Instance**: Creates an EC2 instance with a humorous motivational message in `/motivation.txt`.
   - **Filename**: `motivational_greeting_ec2.tf`
8. **Random Compliment EC2 Instance**: Provisions an EC2 instance with a random compliment in `/compliment.txt`.
   - **Filename**: `random_compliment_ec2.tf`

## How to Use Exercises

1. Navigate to the `terraform/exercises/` folder.
2. Run `terraform init` in the folder for the exercise you want to test.
3. Apply the configuration with `terraform apply`.
4. To clean up, use `terraform destroy`.
